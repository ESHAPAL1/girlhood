                <p>This apron, dating from 1880-1900, is currently not on view at the National Museum of American History. It was donated by Mr. and Mrs. L.G. Arp.
                    Aprons as a Symbol of Domesticity and Preparation for Womanhood: During this era, societal expectations for girls heavily centered around domesticity and preparing for roles as wives and mothers.
                    Aprons, primarily worn for practical purposes during household chores, could symbolize this expectation.
                    Teaching Domestic Skills: Young girls were often taught sewing, cooking, and other domestic skills, and wearing an apron might have been part of this learning process, visually linking them to their expected future roles.

                <p>This three-piece wool suit, consisting of a tunic, long pants (bloomers), and a jacket, was likely worn by Ellen Jane Knight Bradford in the early 1860s.
                    Bradford was an educated woman from Easthampton, Massachusetts who, after graduating from the Williston Northampton School, worked as a music teacher, 
                    married a Congregational minister, and became involved in various educational and reformist endeavors. The suit was considered a more practical and healthy alternative to the heavy,
                    restrictive dresses that were fashionable at the time. The Bloomer dress, popularized by Amelia Bloomer, was controversial for its association with women's rights activism and its perceived unfemininity.
                    The suit features some stylistic details and would have been suitable for outdoor exercise, reflecting the emphasis on health reform during that era.
                    The suit was donated to the National Museum of American History by Faith Bradford and is currently not on view</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>This outfit, consisting of a leather jacket and satin brassiere, was worn by Selena Quintanilla-PÃ©rez during two performances at the 14th Annual Tejano Music Awards on March 14, 1994,
                    at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. This is the same outfit depicted on the Selena Memorial statue in Corpus Christi, Texas.
                    The outfit reflects Selena's unique style, which blended the rebellious sexiness of pop stars like Janet Jackson and Madonna with the sensibilities of a working-class Mexican American woman.
                    Selena's family donated the costume to the Smithsonian, where it is currently part of the Entertainment Nation exhibition at the National Museum of American History.
